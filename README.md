# CS195-Fall24-Notebook #1
## Image whitening and histogram equalization!

<b>Due</b>: Friday, September 13th, 2024

## How this is going to work: 

I've provided some starter code for you. Before you go any further, click on the `notebook1_whiteing_starter.ipynb` and `notebook1_histogram_equalization_starter.ipynb` links in the repository, and then, at the top of the notebook, you will see a button that says `Open in Colab`. Click on this and it will open the starter code in Google Colaboratory.

## The Images
For this notebook, you will need the following two images:
- **Image#1**: [this link](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-1/blob/main/data/first_photograph.png).
- **Image#2**: [this link](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-1/blob/main/data/himalaya_dark.png).
 
First things first: upload the images to your Google Drive and then mount your Drive to the notebook. I aim to help everyone get familiar with the programming environment and comfortable working with pixel values in images. There will be two tasks: you'll perform various per-pixel transformations on images and observe the results.
# **Task#1**: Whitening Transformation
You will be adjusting the contrast of the image. Your goal is to transform the image so that the resulting image has a zero mean and unit variance. Denote the image as $I(.)$ which is a 2D array of pixel values. Its width and height are $N$ and $M$ pixels respectively. Also $I(x,y)$ denotes the pixel value at 2D location $(x,y)$.

You can compute the mean and variance of the gray-scale image $I(.)$ as follows:

<!--$\mu$ = $\frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}\sum_{y=1}^{M}I(x,y)}{N \times M}$
\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{N}\sum_{y=1}^{M}(I(x,y)-\mu)^2}{N*M}-->

Now, you can transform each pixel value separately using the above two computed statistics $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma$ (standard deviation) as follows:

    I^{'}(x,y) = \frac{I(x,y)-\mu}{\sigma}


Apply this \textit{Whitening Transformation} on the provided input image to see how it affects. The following figures show the effect of applying \textit{Whitening Transformation} on the first-ever photograph -- ``\textbf{View from Window at Le Gras}''.
# **Task#2**: Histogram Equalization


## What you need to do :exclamation:
<b>Notebook #1 consists of the following exercises</b> [ 1 point each ]:
1. Print out all of the unique values for the `Type 1` column of the dataset. 
  > *Hint: I'm looking for each possible primary type to be ouput once, not a list of the primary type of each pokemon. For example, if I tossed a coin 3 times and got Heads, Tails, Heads, the unique values of the coin flip are Heads and Tails. There is a function for this.*
2. Create a subset of data representing pokemon whose primary type is **Fire** ðŸ”¥, and the second type is **Flying** ðŸ¦…. Save this DataFrame to the variable name `fire_flying_pokemon`. Display the first 5 lines of this subset.
3. Using `fire_flying_pokemon`, what is the median **Attack** of Fire Flying Pokemon?
4. Create a subset with only pokemon from Generation I. Include 5 columns, the `Generation`, `Name`, `Type 1`, `Type 2`, and `Total`. 
  - *For an extra challenge, see if you can do this in one line.*
5. Which primary type of pokemon is the overall strongest? (not looking for philosophical debates here, I'm looking at the average of the 'Total' column, [grouped by](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) Type--so Fire v Water v Grass etc.). 
6. **Do something cool**. Using the Pokemon dataset, get creative and show me something about the dataset. Use a text cell to explain what you did. 
 - *Need some help getting started here? Try asking a question about the dataset and see if you can use Python and Pandas to answer the question*

Use a Markup cell to put your name at the top of the file. Submit this assignment through the CodePost link (find it on Blackboard).

## :white_check_mark: Grading: 
I will update the following rubric with your grade after you have completed the assignment.
